## Multi-processing in Python

Today will be a discussion of using the `multiprocessing` module from Python.
While I will try to make it as general as possible, but I will primarily
focus on the use of the `multiprocessing` package in Nosetests because
that is how I learned it.

Code examples can be found [here][code].
