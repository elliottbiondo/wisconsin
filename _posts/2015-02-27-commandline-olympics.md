## Elliott Biondo

I am a fourth year graduate student in nuclear engineering working under Paul
Wilson. My research is in radiation transport methods for nuclear activation
problems encountered in fusion energy devices.

## Command-line Olympics

The Command-line Olympics will be a competition between small teams to complete
a series of tasks, each requiring a single UNIX command.  Participants should
bring laptops; there will need to be at least one laptop per group with access
to a UNIX command-line. 

At the beginning of the hour, participants will form small groups and those
with a lot of experience will be encouraged to spread out. Then a text file
will be distributed, containing around 20 challenges of increasing difficulty.
The tasks range in difficulty from printing the contents of files to producing
animated plots (and more!). Completing these challenges will require the heavy
use of search engines and online resources.  Each team will produce a single
shell script with their solutions. After 45 minutes (or as time permits) each
team will be asked to run their shell script on one of the wall monitors so we
can judge their progress.  Whoever completes the most challenges--in
order--will be the winner. Each team will be allowed 1 skip and 2 hints. It is
highly unlikely that any team will complete all of the challenges within the
allotted time. Answers will then be posted for a short group discussion.
